## Hi there 👋

I'm Alina — an astrophysicist working on galaxy evolution, stellar populations and mock spectral datasets.  
I'm currently completing my PhD as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow at the University of Padova.

In this GitHub you can find:
- [**skirt-run**](https://github.com/AIkhsanova/skirt-run) — scripts for generating mock galaxies using radiative transfer calculations (SKIRT)
- [**LightCurve**](https://github.com/AIkhsanova/LightCurve) — modelling stellar light curves (course project)
- [**DZ18**](https://github.com/AIkhsanova/DZ18) — automated test suite developed during the QA automation course (Tinkoff Fintech)
  
<!--
**AIkhsanova/AIkhsanova** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
